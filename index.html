       In evolutionarily advanced species, from rodents to humans, the biological brain orchestrates computations performed by hundreds of millions to billions of neurons, giving rise to behaviors emerging from
       this highly parallelized system. To model neural activities efficiently, down-sampling of the neuronal density is often required. Meanwhile, models inspired by neural computation can scale up to millions
       or even billions of parameters. While the interpretability of neuro-inspired artificial neural networks
       (ANNs) is essential for evaluating their reliability, robustness, biological plausibility, and trustworthiness, their structural complexity often makes them difficult to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop will begin with an overview of interpretability challenges in modeling the nervous system, highlighting solutions from the perspective of explainable AI (XAI). We will examine the
        obstacles faced by the experimental and computational neuroscience communities in data analysis, model development, and dataset integration. Through these examples, we will explore how XAI methods can be used to probe the inner workings of neuro-inspired ANNs.

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
